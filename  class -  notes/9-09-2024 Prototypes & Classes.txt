constructor: is a special kind of method used to create objects from prototypes or classes
-An ES6 class can only have ONE constructor
-If we don't create a custom constructor, JavaScript will provide us the default constructor

Class members: properties, constructor, function

INHERITANCE: It is a common concept used in all programming languages
It increases code reusability by child classes from parent classes
Public properties, functions, and constructors of the parent classes can be inherited
Private properties and functions in parent classes can't be inherited
Parent can't inherit from child 
One child class can ONLY have one parent
One parent class can have multiple child classes 





class A extend B {

}

class C extend A{

}


A is the child class
B is the parent class
