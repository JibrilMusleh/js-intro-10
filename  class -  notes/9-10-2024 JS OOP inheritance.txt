Inheritance: it is building a parent-child relationship between two classes or prototypes.
In this case, child class or prototypes will be able to use (not private) parent members (functions,
properties, constructor).


-one parent can have multiple child that extends from it 
-one child can extend to one parent only


How to achieve Inheritance?
we use extends key word

What is method overriding?
when child class inheriting parent class but changes the method body.

what is method overloading?
When you are able to use a method with different arguments


Method overriding vs method overloading
overriding happens in the case of Inheritance and when child class re-implements a new body for a parent class method
overloading is just using the same method name with diffent arguments 


super() is used to inherit parent constructor into child constructor
