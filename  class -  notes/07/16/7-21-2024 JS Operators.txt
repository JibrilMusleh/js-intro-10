Recap: 

Data types:
1. Primitives
    - Programmers cannot create primitive data types.
    1. string: text
    2. number: absolute/ decimal numbers
    3. boolean: true/false
    4. undefined: variable declared but not assigned witha  value.
    5. null: stating the absence of the data/value
    6. bigint: large numbers
    7. symbol: symbol 

2. Reference Types (Objects)
    - You are allowed to create your custom objects or reference types.

Arrays: used to store multiple data taht is similar(not neccessarily)

Objects: used to store key value pairs (properties)



= vs == vs ===

=   assignment operator

comparison
==      (loose)         checks only values and returns true if they are the same value.
===     (string)        checks both the value and types.

Remainder/Modules

27 % 6 = 3
104 % 5 = 4
69 % 7 = 6


20 % 5 = 0
3 % 6 = 3

1. If the number on the left of the operator is less than the one on the right, then the remainder is theh left number.
2. If the number on the left is divisible by the number on the right, then it is zero.
3. If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, then you wil calculate and find the remainder.

3 ** 3 - 10 + 25 % 2 + 7 =  25
