Number Object is more complex than the primitive number 
-It is a built-in object.
-It has its own properties and functions.

Properties:
MAX_VALUE
MIN_VALUE 

Property: the object information (what it has)
function: the object behaviors(what it does)

property = state = field = instance variables

JavaScripts provides us some global functions you can invoke without referencing from any objects.

isNaN()
parseFloat()
parseInt()
isFinite()
