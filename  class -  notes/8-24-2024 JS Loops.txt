Loops: they are used to run a block of code many times.

1. FOR LOOP:
initialization
condition
update - change



INFINITE LOOP: a loop that never terminates
for(let i = 10; i > 1; i++) {
    console.log(i)
}


for( ; ; ) {
    console.log('Hello')
}


2. WHILE LOOP

while(condition) {
    // block of code to execute
}

let written = 1;
let guess = undefined;

while(guess != written) {
    guess = getRandomNumber(1, 10)
}

console.log('Numbers finally matched!');


3. DO WHILE LOOP
